	* Imakefile: don't link to -lXaw - we have our own widgets.

	* Swisswatch.ad, SWatch.ad, SWatch-co.ad: the second hands are now
	always last in the list of children.  That way, it can be
	eliminated by decrementing the "nChildren" resource.  When the
	"tickTime" is increased to 60, the user gets a less
	resource-intensive clock (proposed by Bill Sebok
	<wls@astro.UMD.EDU>).

	* swisswatch.man: added Amir Katz' fixes
